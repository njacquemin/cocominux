# CocoMinux

__Version 0.0.1__

## What's CocoMinux ?

I wanted an app that does :
* Cocotte-Minute
* Chronometer
* Timer
* etc.

And...

* CRUD the precedent choices
* Start|Pause|Stop|Restart timers
* CRON-style but I'm not sure a PWA can do that if closed...
* etc.
* (I'm pretty tired so I can't think about the rest)

And...

* A progressive web app so I can use it on my phone and on my laptop... and everywhere either ways.
* __IN THE END__ : I want to experiment and having fun because those are the most important.
